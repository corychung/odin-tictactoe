# The Odin Project: Tic Tac Toe

This project was fun to test out the revealing module pattern I learned. I think now I've gotten the hang of it but it took a lot of backtracking (and Googling of course). Again, I would like to refactor the code to make it more clean, as there are some modules that aren't as hidden as I'd like (example: I want to figure out how to not need ```displayController```'s ```render()``` method exposed). I would also like to change the player module to see if it would be better as a factory along with two separate player 1 and player 2 modules. Will play around and see.
